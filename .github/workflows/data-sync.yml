name: Data Sync Cron Job

# DESIGN STRATEGY:
# This workflow demonstrates our data synchronization strategy for keeping the persistence layer
# (PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, etc.) updated with fresh data from external APIs.
#
# ARCHITECTURE:
# 1. BATCH CONSUMPTION: Our data-sync tool fetches data from specific endpoints we want to batch consume
#    - Hotel properties: /v3.0/property/{hotelID}
#    - Reviews: /v3.0/property/reviews/{hotelID}/{count}
#    - Translations: /v3.0/property/{hotelID}/lang/{language}
#
# 2. PERSISTENCE LAYER REFRESH: Updates our database with fresh data
#    - Handles upserts for idempotent operations
#    - Maintains data consistency with transactions
#
# 3. CACHING STRATEGY: Critical data (like reviews) can be cached with TTL
#    - Redis for fast access
#    - TTL-based invalidation for data freshness
#    - Fallback to database when cache misses
#
# DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
# - GitHub Actions (as shown here)
# - AWS Lambda with EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)
# - Kubernetes CronJobs
#
# This approach ensures our API serves fresh data while maintaining performance through caching.
